      <h1>About the Gentleman Ride</h1>
      <p>
        The Gentleman Ride is an annual charity motorcycle event that brings together riders from around the globe to raise funds and awareness for prostate cancer and men’s mental health. 
        Founded in 2013, the ride has become a symbol of camaraderie, unity, and support among the motorcycle community.
        Every year, thousands of riders don their best gentleman attire and hit the road for a cause, raising millions of dollars to support men’s health initiatives. 
        The event is not just about riding; it’s about creating a community that supports and uplifts one another while promoting important health messages.
